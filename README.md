# Covid detection using ResNet-50

## Introduction

We use ResNet-50 Convolutional neural network in detection of Covid from chest X-rays.
We will be using Tensorflow framework to deploy the neural networks.
ResNet-50 is a convolutional neural network that is 50 layers deep and the pretrained network can even classify about 1000 object categories.



## Dependencies

* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
*  [Tensorflow-2.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
*  [Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10Fy2A5dga1jERfFhxQRvII1f2nqnwCqq?usp=sharing)

If you dont have Python installed in your PC ,it can be installed from here [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Hit the command in CMD/Terminal if you don't have it already installed:

    pip install -r Requirements.txt

    
## How to run the code
Clone the Repository and extract the files
