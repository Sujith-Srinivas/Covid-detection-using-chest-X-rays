# Covid detection using ResNet-50

## Introduction

*We use ResNet-50 Convolutional neural network in detection of Covid from chest X-rays.
*We will be using Tensorflow framework to deploy the neural networks.
*ResNet-50 is a convolutional neural network that is 50 layers deep and the pretrained network can even classify about 1000 object categories.


## Dependencies

* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
*  [Tensorflow-2.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
*  [Dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/s/e1r2laj50nh4tez/COVID-19_Radiography_Dataset.zip?dl=0)
If you dont have Python installed in your PC ,it can be installed from here [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Hit the command in CMD/Terminal if you don't have it already installed:

    pip install -r Requirements.txt

    
## How to run the code
Clone the Repository and extract the files

1. Go to the folder where .py file is present
2. Type cmd in the file path 
2. Run the code with command ` python Covid.py`
3. Press "Esc" to exit the window
